From College days working on Technology and Reading books like
a. Electronics world
b. Dr Dobb's Journal
c. IEEE Sprectum
d. Electronics For Uou
e. Data Quest
f. ACM journal

was nt gibbt along with kannada novels.
a
I was really more interested in Electro magnetics and
Read Antennas book from Balanis completely.

This helped me to get into IISc and i worked in 
electromagnetics and published papers along with others.

Got some control on software development when i did
image processing project in academics.

This helped me to think and come up with lot of ideas in
embedded and software world.

After joining IISc along with my work i started  helping
others in doing their work/projects and I believe this
 created me opportunity to understand lot of new technology
without much effort and get a wide variety of ideas in
different verticals.

Following are some ideas and projects i helped to
students coming out of college or people who are working
in specific domain.

a. develop a Sound pressure meassing device
b. Stepper motor based valve control fr flow of water
to your garden based on the input from remote software
connected through wireless
c fuel gauge monitor using PIC  micro controller
d Weather monitoring device using ARM SAM7
e. Weather monitoring Software using  wxWidgets.
f. opengl based object modelling software
g.HMU - health monitoring unit for Racks and Data center
based on Atmel 8052 micro controller connected
using serial port. This temerature monitoring unit
interfaced with ADC and takes input through SPI interface.
The controller is interfaced with MAX232 to chip to
give TTL output.
h. GPS logger device with wavecom gps/gprs module, Simcom gsm/gprs module
based on Atmel SAM ARM9 controller running linux.

i. development of SIP based voip device using Atmel SAM9 controller
running linux.
j. development of linux based hmu.
k. linux basd fire control module
l. integration of directfb based application for gps/gprs based
Ambulance tracking device.
m. Gaming console with web ui for automated anthaxari detection, voice
cancellation device for office cabs with integration to mobile.
b, gos logger, 9-axis with gyro sensor controlled using linux
2.6  ernel.

o. development of Wireless sensor mote device based on 
Atmel AVR with distributed computing nodes part of a
map and reduce job.

p. development of billing and tracking application with
sms alerts for petrol delivery vehicles in the
gas station. This software should not allow payment
or data update until sms confirmation recieved from
head office fo proper delivery of gasoline by transport vendor.

q. development of linux kernel driver and framework for
controlling spi io expander devices from user space.

r. integration of qemu pci proxy for real pci devices along with
delivery of pci interrupts using sysfs interface.

s.  development of usb user space driver for linux for
a finger print module also integrated same with libfprint after
the release of libfprint.

t. development of microwindows/nano-x based device for
monitoring and control of CAD/CAM machines with HMI interface.

u. The time when linux didn't had any matured touch ui
interface, Time when there was no limo, no maemo, no migo
arrived in the world. the opie project or qte project
was available. I  helped people to evaluated Xynth and
other window managers and helped to develop unique touch based
handheld device using gtk tolkit.

v. development of precision farming device framework for
recieving different sensor data.

y.  development of RSS reader and in flight entertainment system
with more games and entertainment data and capability to ebook
reading.
z. wireless sensor custom mesh protocl or adapting DLMS for
smart meter over 6lowpan.

a1. bluetooth based advertising daemon
a2. shabdshilpa - baraha like qt based editor for linux



still there are lot of projectsa i will upload one by one
which are feasible to do.
